I WANT TO DECLARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES
OF MY AUNT, MY FATHER’S SISTER, AND I.
THERE ARE FIVE CHILDREN IN MY FAMILY
AND I’M THE FIRST CHILD.
MY AUNT SAID SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN CARE
OF THE DAILY OF MY LIFE FOR A LONG TIME
YEAR BY YEAR.
I SHOULD SACRIFICE MY WHOLE LIFE TO
GIVE HER ACCOMPANION LIKE HER HUSBAND.
I WONDER THE OTHERS DUTY OF HER.
HOW ABOUT MY PRIORITIY IN HER HEART IN
THE PAST.
LOVE PRIORITY, WEALTH PRIORITY..
I DIDN’T GET ANY OF IT, EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT.
DID YOU ADMIT YOU ASKED TOO MUCH.
