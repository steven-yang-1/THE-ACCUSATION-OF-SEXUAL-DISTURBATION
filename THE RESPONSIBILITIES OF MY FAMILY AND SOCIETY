I WONDER WHO YOU FELT IN LOVE AND WHO YOU MAKE LOVE TO THESE YEARS AND EVERYDAY.
IS HE MY BOYFRIEND.
THE SOUND OF YOU AND MY BOY WERE PLAYING IN MY ROOM.
YOU SAID THE ILLUSION MAKES ME MAD, YOU AND MY BOY ARE NOT GOOD, I'M GOOD ENOUGH AND I'M NOT SELECTED IN FACT.
I'M BLAMED I OWN MONEY TO MY FATHER AT LEAST HE PAID MY DAILY AND EDUCATION, KEEPING GOOD RELATIONSHIPS TO MY TEACHERS, DRUNK HUNDERED BOTTLES OF ALCOHOL.
HOW ABOUT A BODY OF VIRGIN.
DID I DESERVE TRUE LOVE.

MY AUNT YANG MIN WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH(THEY ARE TWINS AND THE OTHER AUNT OF YANG).
COULD YOU BLAME BO YIBO'S DECISION INSTEAD OF BULLYING A TEENAGE OF 18.
YOU DIDN'T TEACH HIM ANYTHING A PARENT SHOULD DO.

MY AUNT, YANG CONG, SAID SHE CARE MY LIFE.
I WAS SENT TO THE HOSPITAL BY MY FATHER WITHOUT BEING TOLD.
AFTER THE PRISON-LIKE AND HELL-LIKE PAINFUL TREAMENTS, THE DOCTOR LET ME KNOW I GOT BIPOLAR DISORDER.
THE FIRST MONTH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHY I WAS IN THE CRAZY PLACE.
AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL, I ASKED FOR MONEY, JUST A MONTH'S SALARY OF A COMMON EMPLOYEE.
A MONTH'S SALARY TO PURCHASE ALL MY LIFE.

YANG CONG WAS NOT ALONE.
SHE HAS BOYFRIENDS IN SHANGHAI.
NOW SHE IS NOT SINGLE.
IF YOU THINK I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH, PLEASE RESORT TO LAW.
DON'T GOSSIP ME AND I DON'T KNOW.
I LOST MY LIFE BECAUSE I DON'T DESERVE THE BEST IN YOUR EYES.

EXAMING GOOD TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD IS A MAN'S RESPONSIBILITY.

MY GRANDMA DIDN'T GET MY BEST CARE BEFORE SHE DIED.
YOU GOTTA CHOOSE YOUR GRANMA OR THE BOY YOU LOVE.
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND I.
HOW ABOUT THE ROMANCE OF MY PARENT AND MY BOY.
AM I GOOD ENOUGH OF HIS LOVE.
WHAT'S THE FACT.

MY YOUNGER TWINS BROTHERS SAID I'M PEDOPHINE AND MADE LOVE TO THEM.
I'M NOT AND THEIR FIRST LOVE ARE MEN.

MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER DIVORCED AND LEFT THE OBLIGATION IN THE SIGNED DOCUMENT.
MY MOTHER SAID I'M IMPOLITE TO HER AND I DESERVE TAKING CARE FOR HER REST LIFE IN THE FUTURE AND SACRIFICE MY ALL.
HOW TO BE A MOTHER AND WHAT A MOTHER SHOULD DO.
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME ANYTHING EVEN YOUR CARE.
AFTER DECADES, YOU SAID YOU ARE ALWAYS FINDING YOUR CHILD, STEVEN YANG.
AND I WAS ALWAYS RUDE TO YOU.
SO YOU MARRIED MY BOY AND I FELL.
