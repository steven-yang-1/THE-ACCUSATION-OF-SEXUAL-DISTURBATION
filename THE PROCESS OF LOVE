IF TIME COULD RETURN, I'D RATHER NOT HAPPENED.


THE PROCESS IS NOT DELIGHTFUL TO YOU.
I DESIRE.
NOBODY KNOWS THE ACTUAL. PERHAPS GOOD OR BAD.
IF I GET THE HAPPINESS LIKE YOU, AT LEAST I CAN'T SURPASS THE BORDER YOU SET TO THE WORLD.
COULD ANYBODY OVERCOME THE EDGES I MENTIONED ABOVE.


THE INCOMPLENESS OF CHOOSE TO LOVE.

YOU OR I DIE.
